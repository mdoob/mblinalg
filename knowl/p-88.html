<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Recall that one of our basic techniques for solving a system of equations is to pick a variable, make the coefficients of that variable equal in two equations and then take the difference of the equations to create a new one with that variable eliminated. In terms of the associated augmented matrix, this means we get a new row formed by subtracting the corresponding entries in the rows of the two equations.  In other words, we replace one row by the difference of two rows. We use the notation \(R_i\gets R_i-R_j\) to indicate that row \(i\) is replaced by the difference of row \(i\) and row \(j\text{.}\)  The set of solutions is unchanged. We have already seen that multiplying a row by a nonzero constants leaves the set of solutions unchanged; it is often convenient to combine these two steps as one: \(R_i\gets R_i+\lambda R_j.\) Note that \(\lambda=-1\) is the case of subtracting one row from another.</p>
