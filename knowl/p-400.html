<p>If every row in the reduced row echelon form of \(A\) has a leading one, then, since \(A\) has the same number of rows as columns, so does every column.  This means that the leading ones must be on the diagonal, and the every other entry of the matrix is zero. In other words, the reduced row echelon form is \(I_n.\) If, on the other hand, some row does not have a leading one, then it is an all-zero row.  Since these rows are at the bottom of the matrix when it is in reduced row echelon form, the last row, in particular, must be all zero.</p>
