<p>If \(t\) is to the left of \(1\text{,}\) then \(kt\) is replaced by \(1t\) and \(t1\) is replace by \(tk\text{.}\) Clearly \(t1\) is an inversion and \(1t\) is not, and so there is a net loss of one inversion. Also \(tk\) is an inversion if and only if \(kt\) is not, and so the number of inversions involving \(t\) either stays the same or is decreased by \(2\text{.}\) Finally the interchange itself of \(k1\) to \(1k\) reduces the number of inversions by one, so the total number of inversions is reduced by one or three. In either case, the parity of the number of inversions changes as the interchange moves the permutation one step closer to being in natural order.</p>
