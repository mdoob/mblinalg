\begin{equation*}

<p data-braille="continuation">By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PermutationSignDefinition.html" title="Definition 3.6.6">DefinitionÂ 3.6.6</a> we need to keep track of the number of interchanges needed to put \(\sigma\) into natural order. If \(i_1=1\text{,}\) the first position is in natural order we are finished with the that position. Nothing has changed, including the number of inversions. Otherwise, we need to interchange whatever is in the first position with \(1\text{,}\) and we need to know the effect of that interchange on the parity of the number of inversions. Here is the situation before interchanging \(1\) and \(k\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma=
\begin{pmatrix}
1\amp       \amp \cdots\amp        \amp j\amp      \amp\cdots\amp      \amp n\\
k\amp \cdots\amp t     \amp \cdots \amp1 \amp\cdots\amp u    \amp\cdots\amp i_n
\end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">If \(u\) is an entry to the right of \(1\text{,}\) then the interchange of \(1\) and \(k\) causes the pairs \(ku\) and \(1u\) to be replaced by \(1u\) and \(ku\) respectively, and so the number of inversions is unchanged as far as \(u\) is concerned.</p>
<p>If \(t\) is to the left of \(1\text{,}\) then \(kt\) is replaced by \(1t\) and \(t1\) is replace by \(tk\text{.}\) Clearly \(t1\) is an inversion and \(1t\) is not, and so there is a net loss of one inversion. Also \(tk\) is an inversion if and only if \(kt\) is not, and so the number of inversions involving \(t\) either stays the same or is decreased by \(2\text{.}\) Finally the interchange itself of \(k1\) to \(1k\) reduces the number of inversions by one, so the total number of inversions is reduced by one or three. In either case, the parity of the number of inversions changes as the interchange moves the permutation one step closer to being in natural order.</p>
<p>Each step (interchange) that moves the permutation closer to natural order changes the parity of both the number of inversions and the number of steps needed for completion, so the parities of the two numbers start the same and remain the same, or they start opposite and remain opposite. When the permutation is finally in natural order, the number of steps necessary to put it into natural order is zero, as is the number of inversions, so the parities are the same and hence must have been identical to start with. This in turn implies the desired conclusion of the theorem.</p></article></body>
