<p>Notice that all of the points lie on a straight line that passes through \(\vec 0=(0,0)\text{.}\) In addition, if we start from \((0,0)\) and follow the line through the first quadrant, we pass through \(\vec 0\text{,}\)  \(\frac12\vec v\text{,}\) \(\vec v\text{,}\) \(2\vec v\) and \(3\vec v\) in that order. It would seem that as \(t\) starts at \(0\) and increases through positive values, the points \(t\vec v\) starts at \(\vec0\) and moves along the line in the first quadrant. Similarly, as  \(t\) starts at \(0\) and decreases through negative values, the points \(t\vec v\) starts at \(\vec0\) and moves along the line in the third quadrant.</p>
