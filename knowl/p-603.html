<p>Here is an example to see how the proof actually works. The second row (in red) and sixth row (in green) will be interchanged. The red row is interchanged with the one below it until it is just below the green row. Then the green row is interchanged with the one above it until it is in the position originally occupied by the red row. It takes four interchanges to get the red row below the green row and three interchanges to get the green row in the original position of the red row.</p>
