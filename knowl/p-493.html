<p>Each matrix associated with the three elementary row operations has an inverse.  While it is easy to define and verify the matrix in each case, it is useful to think of the effect of the inverse. If \(E\) is the matrix associated with an elementary row operation, then \(EA\) carries out that operation on \(A.\) Since \(E^{-1}EA=A,\) the effect of \(E^{-1}\) is to undo the operation and return \(A\) to its original form.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If \(E\) corresponds to interchanging two rows (\(R_i\leftrightarrow R_j\)), to undo the operation we just interchange them again. This means the \(E^{-1}=E.\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(E\) corresponds to multiplying a row by \(\lambda\) (\(R_i\gets\lambda R_i\)), then multiplying the same row by \(\tfrac1\lambda\) returns it to its original form. Hence \(E^{-1}\) is formed by replacing \(\lambda\) by \(\tfrac1\lambda\) in \(E\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(E\) corresponds to adding \(\lambda\) times row \(j\) to row \(i\) (\(R_i\gets R_i+\lambda R_j\)), then subtracting \(\lambda\) times row \(j\) from row \(i\) (\(R_i\gets
R_i-\lambda R_j\)) returns  \(A\) to its original form. Hence \(E^{-1}\) is formed by replacing \(\lambda\) by \(-\lambda\) in \(E\text{.}\) i</p></li>
