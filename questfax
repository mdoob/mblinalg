Attention: Kim

This is the information you requested when talking to my daughter on
the telephone this morning. I have included:

    • The latest notice sent to my daughter’s address.
    • The cover letter from my insurance company, Canada Life, 
      indicating payment has been made.
    • The copy of the check sent to you, also provided by my insurance company.

I suspect the problem has been caused by my address. You have sent
your invoices to my daughter’s address 20 Oak Knoll,  Arlington, MA
while my insurance company uses my actual address in Canada as on their
covering letter.

I hope this is all the information you need. If not, feel free to contact
me. My email address is michael@doob.ca and my telephone number is (204)
488-0804. I would appreciate if you could acknowledge receipt of this fax,
and could let me know when the case is resolved.
